# Gif-Creator

I created this application to help users create GIFs using Python.

Im tired of using videos to gif online because sometimes it takes too long and some of the sites contain ads; malware
that is harmful to your computer, and the quality of GIF is low and has more noise.

Using this script you control the framerate, quality of videos you want to use. 
You can also use it offline.

###### Note:
Currently it takes only .MP4 Files.
Future releases will include other video file types and will add Graphical User Interface.
You can also use GIFs as wallpaper.
